"""Calibration infrastructure (Phase 3).

Recommends sc.prob adjustments at the (market × sector) level using realized
prices as ground truth. Report-only: profiles/*.yaml are updated manually
by humans after reviewing output/calibration/YYYY-MM-DD.md.

Sector is proxied by ``BacktestRecord.primary_method`` because the existing
schema does not carry an explicit sector field; primary method correlates
with industry archetype (e.g. dcf_primary≈growth, multiples≈mature,
ddm/rim≈financials, sotp≈conglomerate, rnpv≈biotech).
